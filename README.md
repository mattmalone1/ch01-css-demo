# ch01-css-demo
First challenge for the bootcamp-refactor provided code


## Description
In this challenge the point was to become proficient in the bsics of HTML and CSS. In order to accomplish this it was necessary to try a lot of different tags and to view how the CSS classes split the document into sections. The refactor required that the code be streamlined and redundant CSS declerations be consolidated and removed. By breaking down the nut and bolts of the HTML and CSS a great deal was learned about the basics of web development.
